# About the Project

This project introduces advanced usage of Python generators to efficiently handle large datasets, process data in batches, and simulate real-world scenarios involving live updates and memory-efficient computations. The tasks focus on leveraging Python’s yield keyword to implement generators that provide iterative access to data, promoting optimal resource utilization, and improving performance in data-driven applications.

## Requirements

Proficiency in Python 3.x.

Understanding of yield and Python’s generator functions.

Familiarity with SQL and database operations (MySQL and SQLite).

Basic knowledge of database schema design and data seeding.

Ability to use Git and GitHub for version control and submission.
